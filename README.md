Hi everyone,

I made a toy model based on one extremely simple physical idea:

“Protons emit waves in phase. Neutrons emit the exact same waves but 180° out of phase.”

The resulting interference pattern directly gives all hybrid orbitals and lone-pair regions.

- 6 protons + 6 neutrons → perfect tetrahedral sp³ (109.47°)
- 5p + 6n → trigonal sp² (120°)
- 4p + 5n → linear sp (180°)
- Oxygen (8+8) with two neutron-dominated directions → H₂O angle 104.3° (real 104.5°)
- etc.

Real-time wave interference + Python code included.  
No group theory, no variational method, just classical wave physics.


Question: Is this level of accuracy from such a stupidly simple interference rule already known as a pedagogical tool, or is it new?

Thanks!
